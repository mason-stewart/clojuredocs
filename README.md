# Clojuredocs 2.0

## A fancier version of the classic!

This project aims to make the venerable http://clojuredocs.org easier to keep updated, and easier for the community to edit.

The previous Clojuredocs consisted of three parts: [the actual site](https://github.com/zk/clojuredocs), the [library importer](https://github.com/zkim/clojuredocs-analyzer), and the [external API](http://github.com/dakrone/cd-wsapi.git). The goal is to hopefully keep everything to a single repo. It will hopefully generate a staic HTML/CSS/JS build that will be hostable on GitHub Pages.

Everything should be up by the end of 2013. Open an issue on this repo if it isn't!
